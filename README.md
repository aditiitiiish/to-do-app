# to-do-app
In this task, i make a basic To-Do List app using Python .

You can add, view, and remove tasks.

All tasks are stored in a text file (tasks.txt), so they are saved even after you close the program.

You use lists in Python to manage the tasks.

You use the open() function to read and write to the file.

That’s it — a small app that helps you keep track of tasks from the command line.
